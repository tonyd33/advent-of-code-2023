bro it's just solving a quadratic formula and kinematics.
i'm not even gonna bother overengineering a vim solution.
here's the equation for the range of numbers based on time = T, distance = D
f(T, D) = floor((-T - sqrt(T^2 - 4D)) / -2) + ceil((-T + sqrt(T^2 - 4D)) / -2) + 1

literally just read the file and input that into your favorite calculator
